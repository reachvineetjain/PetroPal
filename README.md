Android app for getting the nearby gasoline stations

This application uses the NearBy API code from Google to build upon a list of nearby gasoline /  petrol stations. The application also uses
the Address API to determine the adddress and find the coordinates of the various gasoline /  petrol stations. These are athen marked on
the Google Map based on the brand of the gasoline /  petrol station. 

What is lacking in the application is to show the price of Gasoline / Petrol on a per gallon/litre basis. This will turn up the competition between the stations to offer a lower price. This information is not available from the various brands on a station to station basis though they do provide details on a city to city basis.
